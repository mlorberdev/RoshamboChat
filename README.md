## **How to Use?**

* Login with an email & password combination.
* Click one of the Roshambo icons to send your turn. When the opposing player submits, the game sends the result to chat and resets the game.
* Click in the message field to send a message.

## ***Future Improvements***
* The chat doesn't scroll as intended.
